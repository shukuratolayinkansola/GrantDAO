# GrantDAO: Decentralized Autonomous Grant Allocation Platform

## üåç Platform Overview

GrantDAO is a revolutionary blockchain-powered platform designed to democratize and streamline the grant allocation process, enabling transparent, community-driven funding for innovative projects across research, social impact, and technological development.

## üîë Key Principles

- **Transparent Funding**: End-to-end visibility of grant lifecycle
- **Community Governance**: Decentralized decision-making
- **Accountability**: Milestone-based fund release
- **Global Accessibility**: Borderless grant ecosystem

## üöÄ Core Features

### 1. Proposal Management
- Permissionless project proposal submission
- Comprehensive evaluation frameworks
- Multi-stage review processes
- Standardized proposal templates

### 2. Community Governance
- Tokenized voting mechanisms
- Stake-weighted decision-making
- Quadratic voting options
- Transparent voting records

### 3. Funding Mechanics
- Escrow-based milestone funding
- Automated fund release
- Performance-linked disbursements
- Multi-cryptocurrency support

### 4. Impact Tracking
- On-chain project progress monitoring

    - Standardized submission formats
    - Initial screening mechanisms

2. **Voting Module**
    - `CommunityVoting.sol`: Implement voting protocols
    - Quadratic and stake-weighted voting
    - Transparent vote tallying

3. **Funding Escrow**
    - `MilestoneEscrow.sol`: Milestone-based fund management
    - Automated fund release
    - Performance verification

4. **Reputation System**
    - `ImpactScore.sol`: Track grantee performance
    - Dynamic reputation calculation
    - Historical project success metrics
